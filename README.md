# Thoughts On 237 ✍️

A forward-looking publication exploring Cameroon's macro landscape — economics, innovation, identity, and development — through a solution-oriented lens.

## About

**Thoughts On 237** (a nod to Cameroon's country code, **+237**) covers the sociopolitical and economic heartbeat of *"Africa in Miniature."* The goal is to move beyond critique and focus on the **cost of inaction** vs. the **benefit of reform**.
